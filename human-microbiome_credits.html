Text: 'Exploring inner space'
<br/>at 02:50 "(HMP)...is a terrific national project, it's kind of like shooting a rocket
into space, these are some of the first shots but eventually it's going to get us to the moon. And what that means is that we'll going to understand how these microbes help keep us healthy and how when things go wrong with the microbes it leads to disease."

Text: 'Our Microbiome: trillions of microbes, 10,000 different species, bacteria , yeasts, viruses... (mostly bacteria)' 
<br/>from "The human body is host to trillions of microbes. These microbes outnumber the body’s cells by 10 to 1."

<br/><br/>also "Our findings include the fact that
healthy humans carry a remarkable diversity of organisms. We found over
10,000 species of microbes living in and on our subjects..."

<br/><br/>and "Organisms expected to be found in the human microbiome, however, may generally be categorized as bacteria (the majority), members of domain Archaea, yeasts, and single-celled eukaryotes as well as various helminth parasites and viruses, the latter including viruses that infect the cellular microbiome organisms (e.g., bacteriophages, the viruses of bacteria)."

Text: 'Our microbiomes are as unique as us but they share the same functionality'
<br/>at 13:01 "everybody's microbes can differ a lot...
What makes this sort of explainable as a healthy microbial community. Is that the jobs that have to
be carried out, different bugs can pick up those jobs..."

<br/><br/>and from: A surprising finding involved microbial metabolism. “It appears that bacteria can pinch hit for each other,” says Dr. Curtis Huttenhower of Harvard School of Public Health and lead co-author for one of the papers in Nature. “It matters whether the metabolic function is present, not which microbial species provides it."

Text: "I am 22,000 human genes and 8 million microbial genes"
<br/>from: "Our findings include the fact that
healthy humans carry a remarkable diversity of organisms. We found over
10,000 species of microbes living in and on our subjects and while the
human genome contains roughly 22,000 genes that specify the human
organism, these microbes contribute more than 8 million different genes,
many of which play critical roles in our own development, nutrition, and
health."

Text: "We are a super-species, human + mutable microbes"
<br/>at 02:54 "And that's true of all of us so everyone in this in this room is a symbiant. And what that means is you are not all eukaryotic or human cells, you are Archaea cells, you are bacteria cells, you are
fungal cells your a multi-species self"

<br/><br/>and from: "I hope that the audience here is realizing sort of one thing when we’re talking about
variability and diversity and dynamics of the microbiome.
Those properties of the microbiome are actually to our benefit. The microbiome
is a mutable, changeable property and that actually can be exploited for
supporting health and curing illness so I think that’s probably a major take
home from our discussion this morning."
